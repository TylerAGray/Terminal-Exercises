Part II
1. What does the man command do? Type in man rm. How do you scroll and get out?
The man command in Unix-like systems is used to display manual pages for various commands and utilities. 
 When you type man followed by a command name, such as man rm, it opens a detailed manual page within the terminal. 
 You can navigate through the manual page using arrow keys or search for specific text using the / key. To exit the manual page and return to the command prompt, simply press the q key.



2. Look at the man page for ls. What does the -l flag do? What does the -a flag do?
	For the ls command, the -l flag provides a detailed list view, including file permissions, number of links, owner, group, file size, and modification time. 
 The -a flag shows all files, including hidden files starting with the ".". 

3. How do you jump between words in the terminal?
To jump between words in the terminal, you can use the Option (or Alt) key + arrow keys.

4. How do you get to the end of a line in terminal?
To get to the end of a line in the terminal, you can press Ctrl + E.

5. How do you move your cursor to the beginning in terminal?
To move your cursor to the beginning of a line in the terminal, you can press Ctrl + A.

6. How do you delete a word (without pressing backspace multiple times) in terminal?
To delete a word in the terminal, you can press Option (or Alt) + Backspace.

7. What is the difference between a terminal and shell?
A terminal is a program that allows users to interact with their computer using text-based commands. 
A shell is a specific type of terminal program that interprets and executes user commands. Essentially, a shell is a command-line interpreter.

8. What is an absolute path?
An absolute path specifies the exact location of a file or directory starting from the root directory. For example, /home/user/Documents/file.txt is an absolute path.

9. What is an relative path?
A relative path specifies the location of a file or directory relative to the current working directory. 
For example, Documents/file.txt is a relative path, assuming the current working directory is /home/user.

10. What is a flag? Give three examples of flags you have used.
A flag, also known as an option or switch, is a command-line argument used to modify the behavior of a command. Three examples of flags are:
-r flag in rm command: Deletes directories and their contents recursively.
-f flag in rm command: Forces the removal of files without prompting for confirmation.
-l flag in ls command: Displays detailed file information in long format.
11. What do the r and f flags do with the rm command?
With the rm command:
The -r flag stands for "recursive" and allows removal of directories and their contents.
The -f flag stands for "force" and allows removal of files without confirmation prompts.
